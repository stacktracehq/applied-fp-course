# Feedback for course

## Liked

* advice/tips on working _with_ the compiler. Type holes, incremental development etc.
* focus on navigating/reading docs
* waargonaut was pretty painless (although we hadn't used aeson, so no real comparison point I guess)
* explanations of contravariant and bifunctor were good.
* concept of replacing spefic types with general placeholders, e.g. f :: IO, g :: Either Error

## Could improve

* Some tests for the modules/levels where testing isn't the focus. This would give students some confidence in their solutions.
* Found it hard to reason about where types/functions were. Particularly in level 4. Are there some common project organisation idioms that are worth talking about?
* Level 4 seemed like a big jump in difficulty. Perhaps the JSON encoding/decoding could be a different levels?
* Understanding of cabal. What it's role is / isn't etc.
* Would be nice for the nix environment to work on Linux and Mac.
* Would be nice for further levels to build on your own work from previous levels. Perhaps git tags or branches can be used to get people up to a working level x instead?
